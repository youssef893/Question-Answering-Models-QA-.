# Question-Answering-Models-QA-.

## There are 2 different categories of QA Modeling

* Domain - systems that are constrained by the input data; we have open and closed systems
    - Open domain systems are for broad questions, not specific to what category of discussion (Wikipedia, World wide web, Alexa, etc...)
    - Closed domain systems are more narrow in its vocabulary and focus on a specific industry or topic (Football, Finance, Tech, Law etc..)
* Question Type - Open ended questions, Yes/No questions, inference questions etc...)
    - Once you determine what type of system you want to establish, you then need to figure out which question type you want your model to focus on
